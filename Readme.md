###Stats!

##Let's get it started

*This is an experimental github repo*

I am using this repo to experiment with different programming languages as well as how they interact with
and handle computer vision and machine learning concepts (logistic regression, linear regression)

**Main Goals**

I will be testing languages in the following order:

    1) R
    2) Mathematica
    3) Haskell
    4) OCamL
    5) Rust

I will add more as it comes. I'm open to pull requests!

:)
